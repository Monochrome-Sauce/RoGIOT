RoGIOT stands for: <br>

**O**utput <br>
**T**erminal

This is a small personal project, a library for an IO controller and 3D graphics with the terminal. <br>
All of the code will be done in C, using the latest standard version I can (currently C17, soon C23) with GNU extensions.

For now the library will only run on Linux systems, or hopefully, all POSIX compliant systems.
